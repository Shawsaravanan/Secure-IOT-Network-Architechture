# Securing Home IoT Setup at Network Architecture Level

This repository contains my MSc Research Project submitted to the
National College of Ireland (School of Computing).

## 📌 Project Overview
The rapid adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) devices in smart homes has
introduced serious security vulnerabilities, including weak authentication,
unencrypted communication, and lack of network isolation.

This project designs and simulates a **secure smart home IoT network**
using layered, network-level security mechanisms.

## 🔐 Key Security Mechanisms
- WPA3 Wireless Encryption
- VLAN Segmentation (Critical vs Non-Critical Devices)
- MAC Address Filtering
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Network Access Control using ACLs
- IDS-based Monitoring (Simulated)

## 🧪 Methodology
Two environments were designed and compared:
1. Insecure flat IoT network (baseline)
2. Secure layered network architecture

Simulation was performed using **Cisco Packet Tracer and GNS3**.

## 📊 Results
- Significant reduction in attack surface
- Prevention of lateral movement between IoT devices
- Improved confidentiality through encrypted communication
- Strong access isolation using VLANs and ACLs
